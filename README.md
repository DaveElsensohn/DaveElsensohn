## About David ðŸ’¬

Developer. Designer. Other things that begin with "D". It's wrapped with a spicy house sauce in a low-carb tortilla and served with a painstakingly organized work ethic with some writing experience drizzled atop.

I have leapt from Web company to Music company and back again over the course of twenty years, growing more focused in the world of making things work, move and interact with other things.

Specialties: Front-end development, Web and Mobile graphics, Web animation, interface design, programming, writing. I do this with React, Javascript, jQuery, HTML, PHP, XML, Sass and CSS, Symfony2, Twig, Photoshop, Illustrator, VIM, AIR, Markdown, Liquid, and often tacos. Formerly: Flash and Actionscript.

Cis-het (he/him), LGBTQ+ friendly. Will be an ally to the best of my ability. Will dance when provoked.
